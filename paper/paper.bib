	abstract = {We present E2EDNA, a simulation protocol and accompanying code for the molecular biophysics and materials science communities. This protocol is both easy to use and suﬃciently eﬃcient to simulate single-stranded (ss)DNA and small analyte systems that are important to cellular processes and nanotechnologies such as DNA aptamer-based sensors. Existing computational tools used for aptamer design focus on cost-eﬀective secondary structure prediction and motif analysis in the large data sets produced by SELEX experiments. As a rule, they do not oﬀer ﬂexibility with respect to the choice of the theoretical engine or direct access to the simulation platform. Practical aptamer optimization often requires higher accuracy predictions for only a small subset of sequences suggested, e.g., by SELEX experiments, but in the absence of a streamlined procedure, this task is extremely time and expertise intensive. We address this gap by introducing E2EDNA, a computational framework that accepts a DNA sequence in the FASTA format and the structures of the desired ligands and performs approximate folding followed by a reﬁning step, analyte complexation, and molecular dynamics sampling at the desired level of accuracy. As a case study, we simulate a DNA-UTP (uridine triphosphate) complex in water using the state-of-the-art AMOEBA polarizable force ﬁeld. The code is available at https://github.com/InﬂuenceFunctional/E2EDNA.},

	abstract = {Aptamer-related technologies represent a revolutionary advancement in the capacity to rapidly develop new classes of targeting ligands. Structurally distinct RNA and DNA oligonucleotides, aptamers mimic small, protein-binding molecules and exhibit high binding affinity and selectivity. Although their molecular weight is relatively small—approximately one-tenth that of monoclonal antibodies—their complex tertiary folded structures create sufﬁcient recognition surface area for tight interaction with target molecules. Additionally, unlike antibodies, aptamers can be readily chemically synthesized and modiﬁed. In addition, aptamers’ long storage period and low immunogenicity are favorable properties for clinical utility. Due to their ﬂexibility of chemical modiﬁcation, aptamers are conjugated to other chemical entities including chemotherapeutic agents, siRNA, nanoparticles, and solid phase surfaces for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, as relatively small sized oligonucleotides, aptamers present several challenges for successful clinical translation. Their short plasma half-lives due to nuclease degradation and rapid renal excretion necessitate further structural modiﬁcation of aptamers for clinical application. Since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the ﬁrst aptamer drug, Macugen® (pegaptanib), which treats wet-age-related macular degeneration, several aptamer therapeutics for oncology have followed and shown promise in pre-clinical models as well as clinical trials. This review discusses the advantages and challenges of aptamers and introduces therapeutic aptamers under investigation and in clinical trials for cancer treatments.},

	abstract = {This brief review recounts how, stimulated by the work of Geoff Burnstock, I developed biosensors that allowed direct real-time measurement of ATP and adenosine during neural function. The initial impetus to create an adenosine biosensor came from trying to understand how ATP and adenosine-modulated motor pattern generation in the frog embryo spinal cord. Early biosensor measurements demonstrated slow accumulation of adenosine during motor activity. Subsequent application of these biosensors characterized real-time release of adenosine in in vitro models of brain ischaemia, and this line of work has recently led to clinical measurements of whole blood purine levels in patients undergoing carotid artery surgery or stroke. In parallel, the wish to understand the role of ATP signalling in the chemosensory regulation of breathing stimulated the development of ATP biosensors. This revealed that release of ATP from the chemosensory areas of the medulla oblongata preceded adaptive changes in breathing, triggered adaptive changes in breathing via activation of P2 receptors, and ultimately led to the discovery of connexin26 as a channel that mediates CO2-gated release of ATP from cells.},

	abstract = {Due to their relative synthetic and chemical simplicity compared to antibodies, aptamers afford enhanced stability and functionality for the detection of environmental contaminants and for use in environmental monitoring. Furthermore, nucleic acid aptamers can be selected for toxic targets which may prove difﬁcult for antibody development. Of particular relevance, aptamers have been selected and used to develop biosensors for environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, small-molecule agricultural toxins, and water-borne bacterial pathogens. This review will focus on recent aptamer-based developments for the detection of diverse environmental contaminants. Within this domain, aptamers have been combined with other technologies to develop biosensors with various signal outputs. The goal of much of this work is to develop cost-effective, user-friendly detection methods that can complement or replace traditional environmental monitoring strategies. This review will highlight recent examples in this area. Additionally, with innovative developments such as wearable devices, sentinel materials, and lab-on-a-chip designs, there exists signiﬁcant potential for the development of multifunctional aptamer-based biosensors for environmental monitoring. Examples of these technologies will also be highlighted. Finally, a critical perspective on the ﬁeld, and thoughts on future research directions will be offered.},

	abstract = {Generating aptamers that bind to speciﬁc metal ions is challenging because existing aptamer discovery methods typically require chemical labels or modiﬁcations that can alter the structure and properties of the ions. In this work, we report an aptamer discovery method that enables us to generate high-quality structure-switching aptamers (SSAs) that undergo a conformational change upon binding a metal ion target, without the requirement of labels or chemical modiﬁcations. Our method is more eﬃcient than conventional selection methods because it enables direct measurement of target binding via ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), isolating only the desired aptamers with the highest aﬃnity. Using this strategy, we obtained a highly speciﬁc DNA SSA with ∼30-fold higher aﬃnity than the best aptamer for Hg2+ in the literature. We also discovered DNA aptamers that bind to Cu2+ with excellent aﬃnity and speciﬁcity. Both aptamers were obtained within four rounds of screening, demonstrating the eﬃciency of our aptamer discovery method. Given the growing availability of FACS, we believe our method oﬀers a general strategy for discovering high-quality aptamers for other ions and small-molecule targets in an eﬃcient and reproducible manner.},

Hence, there is an increased demand to develop robust, easy, and sensitive methods for rapid evaluation of antibiotics and their residues. Among different analytical methods, the aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) have attracted considerable attention because of good selectivity, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity. This review gives an overview about recently-developed aptasensors for antibiotic detection. The use of various aptamer assays to determine different groups of antibiotics, like β-lactams, aminoglycosides, anthracyclines, chloramphenicol, (ﬂuoro)quinolones, lincosamide, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides are presented in this paper.},
